Prime Minister's Questions (often abbreviated to PMQs) is a session held in the House of Commons every Wednesday afternoon where the Prime Minister (Theresa May) answers questions from MPs; specifically the Leader of the Opposition (Jeremy Corbyn).

Quick PMQs offers short summaries of these interactions, attempting to focus on the heart of the issues being discussed by removing political rhetoric or personal attacks.

This website is maintained and developed by me, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jonnykates">@jonnykates</a>. I am a designer and web developer from Bournemouth, UK.

I started Quick PMQs because I was frustrated with the lack of constructive debate during these weekly sessions. Prime Minister's Questions gets a relatively large amount of media exposure and echoes the wider political agenda; yet often the interaction between the leaders yields unfulfilling answers and descends into a political slagging match.

My motivation is to provide a clear and impartial summary of PMQs whilst highlighting the inadequacies of these sessions for the electorate.

#### Development log

This is the second full version of Quick PMQs, which started life as a simple AngularJS experiment. This version is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io); a static site framework. As a frontend developer, I wanted to experiment with Hugo and this personal side project provided a great excuse.

You can follow and contribute to Quick PMQs' development via [GitHub](https://github.com/jonnykates/quick-pmqs).
